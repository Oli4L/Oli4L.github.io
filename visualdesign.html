	  <h1> Project 1</h1>
	  <br>
  <img src="2.png" width="500" height="500" alt=""/>
	  <br>
	   For this project the software used was Photoshop. In order to create the picture like how I did, I had to use many different tactics. My original photo looks like a whole different image compared to the finished result.

  <h1> Project 2</h1>
	  
    <img src="kobes.png" width="500" height="500" alt=""/>
	  <br>
	  The celebrity that I chose for this project is Kobe Bryant. Kobe Bryant was a professional basketball player. I chose this person because heâ€™s been a part of many peoples lives. The tools I used to complete this portrait were, eyedropper - to get an almost identical color to color in the portrait, and pencil - to color in the portrait.

  <h1> Project 3</h1>
  <img src="rainbow.png" width="500" height="500" alt=""/>
	  <br>
	  I made this project by using different tools in Photoshop such as, rotating, scaling, and filling in colors. Adding on, I used a boat as my base shape, and the colors I included were red, purple, yellow, green, and cyan. I noticed the shape turns into something more than a shape like an illusion. This was an interesting task to complete because of the result that came at the end of it.
